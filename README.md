# Unity-Character-Controllers
Unity Scripts for both 1st person and 3rd person, with features such as sprinting, crouching, jumping/double jumping and stanima.
 It is a work in progress as of right now, I will add the 3rd person scripts soon, as well as maybe more features to both of them.

 To use download the scripts and they will have a simple instructions to follow. Its a super quick setup to get a decent amount of features.
